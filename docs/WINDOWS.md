# Windows Users

Terraform makes windows binaries, so you can follow the main instructions for downloading/installing terraform and creating the instance.  However, SSH tunneling is a bit more complex on windows.  You will need to use PuTTYgen and PutTTY to create your SSH keys and use them to connect to the server after it is created.

The *Package files* [from the putty website](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/) will contain both PuTTYgen and PuTTY.

You can follow the directions [in this document](sshtunnel.md) (which was copied from [here](https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~xuanluo/sshproxywin.html)) to set up a SOCKS proxy using PuTTY on Windows.

If someone would like to add more detail to windows instructions that would be greatly appreciated.
